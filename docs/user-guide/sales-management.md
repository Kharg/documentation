## Leads

A Lead represents a person or organization that  is not currently a customer but has the potential to be. Creating a new Lead record is usually the first step in the sale process. As more information about the Lead is gathered,  the Lead is expected to be converted into a Account, Contact, and/or Opportunity.

New Leads are typically created in the following scenarios:

* manually by CRM users;
* through the API (e.g. through a web form);
* automatically by a Workflow rule.

By utilizing the [Workflows](../administration/workflows.md) tool, an administrator can set up the system to apply a specific assignment rule to new Leads. *Round-Robin* and *Least-Busy* rules are available. For more complex business flows, it's recommended to utilize the [BPM tool](../administration/bpm.md).

To prevent overlooking of new Leads, users can add the *Lead* entity type to the *Global Auto-follow* list in Preferences. Then, they will automatically follow every new Lead created in the system they have access to.

### Converting

To convert the lead, you need to click *Convert* button on the lead detail view. Then you can check to what record types you want to convert: Account, Contact, Opportunity.

Converted lead won't be removed from the system. It will have status *Converted*, records it was converted to, will be available on *Converted To* panel on the right.

## Opportunities

An opportunity represents a potential or closed deal. Opportunity with *Closed Won* stage are taken into account in sales revenue calculation (dashlets & reports).

### Stage

The following opportunity stages are available by default:

* Prospecting
* Qualification
* Proposal
* Negotiation
* Closed Won
* Closed Lost

An administrator can define custom stages depending on business flow of the company: Administration > Entity Manager > Opportunity > Fields > Stage. It's also possible to define custom probabilities for each stage.

### Probability

The Opportunity probability is an estimated percentage chance that the sale will be won. *Closed Won* status has the 100% probability, *Closed Lost* â€“ zero. Other stages has their default probabilities. The default probabilities can be modified in the Entity Manager.

Probabilities can be utilized in revenue forecasting.

## Currency

An administrator can define available currencies and their rates at Administration > Currency.

It's possible to convert currency of existing opportunities:

* on the list view: select needed records and then click *Convert Currency* in the *Actions* dropdown,
* on the detail view: click the dropdown next to the *Edit* button, then *Convert Currency*.

## Sales analytics

The following charts are available on the dashboard by default:

* Sales by Month
* Opportunities by Lead Source
* Opportunities by Stage
* Sales Pipeline

By utilizing [Reports tool](reports.md) it's possible to view sales statistics based on specific criteria. Report charts can be displayed on the dashboard.
