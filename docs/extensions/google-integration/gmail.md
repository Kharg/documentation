!!! note

    Before proceeding to this article it's recommended to [set up the integration](setting-up.md).

Gmail Secure Authentication is available in [Google Integration](https://www.espocrm.com/extensions/google-integration) extension. It provides a secure authentication for Gmail accounts via OAuth2. With this extension, you wonâ€™t need to store your Gmail password in EspoCRM and enable access for less secure applications in your Google Account settings.

Note: Using in personal email accounts requires 5.9.2 version or later. Using in group email accounts requires 5.8.0 version or later.

## Setting-up email account

Assuming that the administrator has already set up the integration.

Create a personal or group email account. Specify IMAP and SMTP parameters for Gmail (hosts: `imap.gmail.com` & `smtp.gmail.com`). Leave *Password* fields empty. Then, save the record.

After that, *Gmail* panel should appear on the right. You need to click *Connect* button. A popup will show up asking for a user consent.

!!! note

    You need to be logged in to Google as a user to which an email address of the current email account record belongs. For example, if you configure email account for *example@gmail.com*, you need to log in to Google as a user who has *example@gmail.com* email address.
