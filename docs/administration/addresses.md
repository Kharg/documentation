# Addresses

## Countries

*As of v8.3.*

An admin user can add country names with their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (at Administration > Address Countries).
Added countries will be available in autocompletion in Address fields. 
Counties marked as preferred will be displayed first (on empty input).

Countries can also be [imported](import.md) from a CSV.

A default predefined country list with English names can be optionally loaded. Administration > Address Countries > top-right menu > Populate with default country list.
